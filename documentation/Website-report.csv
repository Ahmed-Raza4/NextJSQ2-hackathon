Mobile,First Contentful Paint,1.7 s,"Time it takes for the browser to render the first bit of content on the screen on mobile. 1.7 seconds is a decent FCP, but faster is always better."
Mobile,Largest Contentful Paint,4.1 s,"Time it takes for the browser to render the largest content element (image, text, etc.) visible within the viewport on mobile. 4.1 seconds is a bit slow; ideally, this should be under 2.5 seconds."
Mobile,Total Blocking Time,0 ms,"The total amount of time that the main thread was blocked and unable to respond to user input on mobile. 0 ms is excellent."
Mobile,Cumulative Layout Shift,0.012,"A measure of how much the layout of the page shifts during loading on mobile. A low score like 0.012 is good, indicating a stable user experience."
Mobile,Speed Index,4.2 s,"How quickly the page's content is visually displayed on mobile.  4.2 seconds is a reasonable speed index, but improvements can be made."
Mobile,Accessibility Issues,"Some image elements are missing alt attributes (important for screen readers). Some links do not have a discernible name (affects usability for everyone, especially those using assistive technology). Contrast issues exist between background and foreground colors (can make text difficult to read for some). Some links rely on color alone (not sufficient for users with color blindness)."
Mobile,Best Practices Details,"Avoids enormous network payloads (total size was 492 KiB - keeping file sizes small is important for performance). Avoids an excessive DOM size (255 elements - a smaller DOM tree improves performance). Avoids chaining critical requests (1 chain found - minimizing the number of dependent resources improves load time). JavaScript execution time: 0.2 s (keeping JS execution time low is crucial for responsiveness). Main-thread work: 0.4 s (minimizing main-thread work ensures a smooth user experience). Third-party code blocked the main thread for 0 ms (good - third-party scripts shouldn't block the main thread)."
Mobile,SEO Issues,"Links do not have descriptive text (affects SEO and accessibility). Image elements do not have alt attributes (negatively impacts SEO and accessibility)."
Desktop,Performance,100,"Overall performance score of the website on desktop. A perfect score of 100 is excellent."

Desktop,SEO Issues,"Links do not have descriptive text. Image elements do not have alt attributes."
Desktop,Diagnostics - Opportunities,"Eliminate render-blocking resources (Potential savings: 230 ms - these resources are delaying page rendering). Properly size images (Potential savings: 40 KiB - images are not optimized for the web). Reduce unused JavaScript (Potential savings: 21 KiB - there's JavaScript code that's being loaded but not used)."
Desktop,Diagnostics - Passed,"Initial server response time was short (Root document took 510 ms - the server responded quickly). Avoid large layout shifts (1 layout shift found - this is a minor issue, but should be investigated). Avoid enormous network payloads (Total size was 619 KiB - the overall page size is reasonable)."
